# Computer Science Studies

This is a complete study of the roadmap proposed by [John Washam](https://github.com/jwasham) in his repository [Coding Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university). I had already started this at some point but never finished, but even though the first part is completed i will redo it (hopefully better) and go from beginning to end on all the non-optional topics, and maybe extend it later to those optional topics.

## Repository Structure

The full roadmap will be in this repository divided by folders, initially as follows (in the process of studying it may change):
* __[Data Structures](./data-structures):__ A remake of the [practice-c](https://github.com/apacha01/practice-c) repository that i already made with all the data structures.
* __[Searching](./searching):__ Searching algorithms like binary search and so.
* __[Sorting](./sorting):__ Sorting algorithms like mergesort and so.
* __[Recursion](./recursion):__ Recursion implementation of some algorithms, probably just practice since i know the concept.
* __[More knowledge](./more-knowledge):__ The *Even More Knowledge* section of the roadmap with a lot of different topics like recursion, dynamic programming, etc.
* __[Extra](./extra):__ Might not be there, this are the optional topics to study after the rest is done (cryptography, compression, etc).

## Chosen Language - C

I wil be using C. The reason is i'm closer to the low level things without going all in like with assembly, and it's also the one i used the first time so i get keep consistency. I also implemented some of them in java but got tired of repeating things in different languages and decided to go full C, so i'll do it all in just one language this time.

## The Flashcards

The guy (john) himself recommends to study only a couple of hours, get to the code and implement and after a certain time you review the information with flashcards. After that you just keep refreshing your memory with flashcards, the longer you do it the longer the time in between revisions that you will need gets. I'll be using my own very simple [flashcards app](https://github.com/apacha01/flashcards-app) that reads a json which you'll find in this repo within the corresponding folder of study.
