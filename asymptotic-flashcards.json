So it gives the average performance, over time, of each operation in the worst-case.\nExample: In a dynamic array, if when pushing an element it causes a resize, then pushing is not O(1). But since this isn't done every time a push occurs, the cost is 'amortized' across all push operations in time for an average performance of O(1).",
